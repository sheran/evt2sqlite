Evt2Sqlite v0.1b - Convert BlackBerry Event Log files to SQLite databases

Evt2Sqlite converts a BlackBerry Event Log file to an SQLite database to make it easier to parse and query 
data about specific events.  The resulting database file has the following schema:

TABLE: EVENT 
Field: GUID STRING
Field: EVDATE DATE
Field: TYPE INTEGER
Field: SEVERITY INTEGER
Field: APP STRING
Field: DATA STRING

For convenience, use the accompanying batch or bash scripts to execute:

e2s.sh evt.log output.db

The example above will read the BlackBerry event log file 'evt.log' and convert it to an SQLite database file
named 'output.db'

To access the database, you can use a standard SQLite graphical client or a command line client:

azazel:Evt2SQLite sheran$ sqlite3 output.db 
SQLite version 3.6.12
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> select count(*) from EVENT;
1968
sqlite> select datetime(EVDATE,'unixepoch') as date, DATA from EVENT where APP like '%phone%' limit 20;
